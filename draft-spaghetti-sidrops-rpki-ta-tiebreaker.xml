    <abstract>
    <t>
        A Trust Anchor (TA) in the RPKI is represented by a self-signed X.509 Certification Authority (CA) certificate.
        Over time, Relying Parties (RP) may have acquired multiple different issuances of valid TA certificates from the same TA operator.
        This document proposes a tiebreaking scheme to be used by RPs to select one TA certificate for certification path validation.
        This document updates RFC 8630.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
        In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) hierarchical structure, a Trust Anchor is an authority for which trust is assumed and not derived.
        TA operators periodically reissue TA certificates to introduce changes to, for example, modify the set of IP Address Delegations and/or Autonomous System Identifier Delegations included in the <xref target="RFC3779"/> extension(s), the content of the Subject Information Access extension (<xref target="RFC5280" section="4.2.2.2"/>), and the certificate validity period (<xref target="RFC5280" section="4.1.2.5"/>).
      </t>
      <t>
        Relying Parties periodically download Trust Anchor certificates from well-known, remote locations and verify that the key of the self-signed certificate matches the key embedded in its associated Trust Anchor LocatorÂ <xref target="RFC8630"/>.
        This transfer may happen via an unauthenticated channel, and the certificate is verified by checking that it is signed by the public key in the TAL.
        After retrieving a TA certificate Relying Parties have a choice between using a previously retrieved locally cached copy of the TA certificate and the newly-retrieved instance of the TA certificate.
      </t>
      <t>
        Some Trust Anchor certificates were issued with extended validity periods, in some cases up to a century.
        Since TA certificates are the root, and thus have no CRL covering them, Trust Anchor operators cannot revoke previously issued TA certificates.
        This means that an on-path adversary or caching network elements could present Relying Parties with an older instance of the TA certificate than the TA operator intends Relying Parties to use.
        This document proposes a tiebreaking scheme for Relying Parties, preferring (1) the 'more recently' issued certificate, and (2) the certificate with the shortest validity period among certificates with equal notBefore.

      <name>Tiebreaker design</name>
      <t>
        The tiebreaker scheme in this document aims to create a partial order over TA certificates issued by the same TA.
        The goal of this order is to, in all realistic scenarios, allow the TA to always issue a certificate that is preferred over any previous certificate.

    <section anchor="security">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
        When Relying Parties inadvertently use a different instance of the TA certificate than the TA operator intended for RPs to use, the certification path validation process will yield an unexpected outcome.
        Some examples of unexpected outcomes are validation failures, or replay attacks.
        Standardization of a tiebreaking scheme helps both RP and TA operators arrive at deterministic outcomes.
        The proposed tiebreaking scheme prevents RPs from accepting a previous certificate presented by an on-path attacker.

      <t>
        This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in <xref target="RFC7942" />.
        The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
        Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
        Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
        This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features.
        Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.
      </t>
      <t>
        According to <xref target="RFC7942" />, "this will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
        It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as they see fit".
